# Script Overview: Dockerized FastAPI Server for GitHub File Retrieval

## Function

This script sets up a Dockerized FastAPI server to retrieve and display files from GitHub repositories.

## Features:

Stop Conflicting Containers: Automatically stops any running Docker containers that may conflict on port 8000.
Server Script Creation: Generates a server.py script for a FastAPI application. This application is capable of fetching files from GitHub repositories based on user, repository name, branch, and file path.
Dependencies Management: Creates a requirements.txt file listing necessary Python packages like FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Requests.
Docker Setup: Includes commands to create a Dockerfile for setting up a Python environment and a Docker Compose file to manage the application.
Deployment: Builds and deploys the FastAPI server using Docker Compose, making it accessible on port 8000.
Testing: Contains an optional test command to ensure the server is functioning correctly by retrieving a specified file from GitHub.
Usage:

Run the script to deploy a FastAPI server in a Docker container.
Access the server at http://localhost:8000/{user}/{repo}/{branch}/{filepath} to retrieve files from GitHub.
