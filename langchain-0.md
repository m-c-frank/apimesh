# Langchain-0 Script Documentation

## Overview

`langchain-0` is an elementary function script in our project. It serves a specific, well-defined purpose: processing two inputs using a Language Model (LLM) chain with GPT-3.5 Turbo and writing the output to a file. This script represents the foundational level of our function hierarchy.

## Naming Convention and Structure

- **Elementary Functions (`langchain-0`, `langchain-1`, etc.):** 
  Each script in the `langchain-n` series represents an elementary function. The number (`n`) indicates the complexity and composition level. 
  - `0` denotes a single, standalone function with a clear purpose.
  - Higher numbers (`1`, `2`, etc.) indicate compositions of multiple elementary functions or more complex operations.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- LangChain library installed
- OpenAI API key set as an environment variable

### Running the Script

1. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x langchain-0.sh
   ```
